* Background
  What are TFs, why are they important?

* Recognition
  - Linear models are popular because linearization of energy function
  - But are there other reasons?
  - Perhaps linearity is selected for due to robustness to mutation

* Formalizing mutational robustness
  - Motif defined as probability distribution over Lmers
  - Jukes Cantor diffusion model carries probability current between nodes
    - write system of ODEs
  - dH/dt or instantaneous Dkl?  Seems like Dkl would be better for this?
 
* Graph Laplacian
  - L = D - A
  - fourier transform
  - show that GL simplifies ODE system
